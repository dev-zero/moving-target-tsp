Moving Target Travelling Salesman Problem Simulation

Requirements
============

To build the application you need:

- cmake
- g++-4.6.x
- Qt-4.7.x
- OpenSceneGraph-3.0.x

Optional dependencies
---------------------

- CLI from http://www.codesynthesis.com/projects/cli/ to build the command-line applications
- Boost to build the initial exhaustive search application (integrated in the moving-target-tsp app by now)

Build Instructions
==================

    mkdir build
    cd build/
    cmake ..
    make

Run
===

Running the application is quiet simple:

    ./moving-target-tsp

everything else can be done using the GUI.

The target manager can also be run seperately:

    ./target_manager_TEST

This way you can put together a list of targets and save it in the application specific format
to be able to load it using the moving-target-tsp-cli command line application:

The CLI application prints out proper instructions on how to call it:

    ./moving-target-tsp-cli --help
